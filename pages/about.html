            42 Huskies is all about <span>winning memories</span>. We play games to <span>connect</span> with others, to <span>fight</span> together, while aiming for a similar goal, to win lasting <span>memories</span>, and to create <span>everlasting</span> legacies.</p>
            <p data-aos="fade-up">The number <span>"42"</span> is a dedication to Naol’s late father, <a class="mieso" href="https://ifip.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/ifip/tc/6/wg/6.9">Mieso K. Denko</a>, as he passed away with <span>liver</span> cancer in 2010 at the age of 42.
            He left a memorable impact in the field of <span>computer science</span>, and was appreciated among peers and faculty. 
            The University of Guelph formed a <span>scholarship</span> named <a class="mieso" href="https://www.uoguelph.ca/registrar/studentfinance/apps/awards?id=E0810">“Mieso Denko Memorial”</a> as a honor to his life’s work in research and education.</p>
            <p data-aos="fade-left">The word <span>"Huskies"</span> is what connects are founders. They met and became roommates at <span>Saint Mary’s University</span>, as they were recruited to play football for the Saint Mary’s Huskies. 
            Thus, made them decide to use Huskies as their mascot and team name.</p>
            <p  data-aos="fade-right">We aim to <span>foster</span> a collective of like-minded individuals who seek to win <span>championships</span> and create a <span>globally</span> acknowledged brand, and most importantly, make <span>memories</span>.</p>
